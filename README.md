# IdleFishing

This is my first attempt at an Idle Game. It uses the Break Inifinty module from https://github.com/Patashu/break_infinity.js.
It was developed with some help from Chat GPT and is planned to be used with Node.JS.

The game can be played from https://iproharper.github.io/IdleFishing/

Create the game script with "browserify main.js -o app.js"
Nginx server should run from index.html
